A decentralized conference hosted by Protocol Labs
"""

description="""
The Protocol Labs Network is hosting our first ever decentralized conference in Lisbon. Teams in the network will spin up dozens of events across Oct 22-Nov 4. These will take many forms, from summits to unconferences to networking happy hours, and cover a wide array of topics, including decentralized storage, public goods funding, cryptoeconomics, DeSci, and many more. Then you get to choose your own adventure for which ones to attend to make the biggest impact. 

We invite you to join us as we drive breakthroughs in computing to push humanity forward.
