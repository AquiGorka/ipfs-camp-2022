## IPFS Camp 2022 Location and Dates

IPFS Camp 2022 is happening October 28th to October 30th, in Lisbon.

## Submitting subevents

There are 2 templates you can choose from to submit a subevent:
1. Use _template-short-event if your event doesn't have structured times throughout. It's short and sweet.
2. Use _template-long-event if your event has a lot of breakout times for different speakers, sessions, OR is going to be multiple days long. This template has timeslots you can fill out to let attendees know what to expect and when.

### Creating an Event

1. Select the short or long template depending on your event.
2. Create a new file and name it your-event-name.toml
3. Fill in the template with details for your event.
4. Create a PR to this repo to add this new file.
5. The Spaceport team will review and merge your event into the website. 

A quick note: If you are submitting an event that is private, it may not show up on the website since most attendees will not be able to attend. If you'd like it to appear in the schedule for some reason, please leave a comment in your PR for the Spaceport team to review.

### Editing an Event

If you've already created your event but want to add or change details in the .toml file, create a PR with your edit requests, along with any comments. The Spaceport team will review and merge your changes to the website.

### CSV dump of talks

To get a dump of talks/speakers for custom analysis, you can:
1. Install the python version of yq: https://github.com/kislyuk/yq
  - ``brew install python-yq``
2. Run a command like ``tomlq -r '.name as $track_name | .date as $track_date | .timeslots[] | [$track_name, $track_date, .startTime, .title, (.speakers | join(" "))] | @csv' *.toml``
