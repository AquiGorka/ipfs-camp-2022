**The goal of this track is to draft a specification for implementing IPFS in a way that separates reading, writing and serving data to and from other applications or contexts, and which can be readily supported in constrained environments such as browsers or mobile devices, and multiple programming languages.**

Web Browsers and mobile applications are both resource-constrained platforms with very short uptimes. They require us to reinterpret how IPFS should perform at the edge, and at the same time, represent a massive category of use.

Even desktop web browsers have performance and security models which require either redifinition of what is considered an IPFS "node" today, or at least a clear modularity of behavior to be configurable by vendors.

This track is structured as an _intense_ half-day workshop. It will start with a brief introduction to frame our work, we'll hear lightning talks on use cases, then move to group discussion, using a design document for group iteration.
