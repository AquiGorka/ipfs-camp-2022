description = """

This track aims to create space for advancing the IPFS project and community. New session proposals are welcome, especially those that focus on a specific, actionable subtopic rather than attempting to grapple with project and community stewardship.

Currently, we have reserved a 1/2 day for this track. If enough sessions are proposed, this track will be extended into Friday afternoon.
